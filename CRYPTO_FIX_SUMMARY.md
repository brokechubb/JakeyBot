## üöÄ **How the Tool Works**

### **Auto-Enable System**

The tool is automatically enabled when users ask for crypto prices:

```
User: "What's the price of Bitcoin?"
JakeyBot: üîÑ **Auto-enabled CryptoPrice** - Jakey needed this tool to help you!
         "üí∞ Current BTC: $110,876.38 USD"
```

### **Supported Usage**

- **Symbols**: BTC, ETH, SOL, BONK, etc.
- **IDs**: 1 (Bitcoin), 1027 (Ethereum), 5426 (Solana)
- **Auto-detection**: Works with natural language queries

### **Response Format**

The tool provides comprehensive market data:

- Current price in USD
- Market capitalization
- 24-hour trading volume
- Price changes (1h, 24h, 7d)
- Visual indicators for price movements

## üéØ **Expected Behavior**

The CryptoPrice tool should automatically activate when users:

1. Ask for cryptocurrency prices
2. Mention specific tokens (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
3. Ask about crypto market data
4. Request price information for any cryptocurrency

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

If the tool is not working as expected:

### **Check Bot Status**

1. Ensure the bot is running with proper environment variables
2. Verify the aiohttp session is initialized
3. Check that the tool is properly loaded

### **Test Commands**

Users can test the tool with:

- "What's the price of Bitcoin?"
- "How much is ETH worth?"
- "Check SOL price"
- "What's the current price of BONK?"

### **Manual Activation**

If auto-enable doesn't work, users can manually activate:

- `/feature CryptoPrice` - Switch to CryptoPrice tool
- Then ask for any cryptocurrency price

## üìã **Configuration**

### **Required Environment Variables**

```bash
# In dev.env
COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### **API Key Setup**

1. Visit [CoinMarketCap Pro API](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Add to `dev.env` file

## ‚úÖ **Conclusion**

The CryptoPrice tool is **fully functional and working correctly**. The auto-enable system is properly configured, and the tool should automatically activate when users ask for cryptocurrency prices.

If users are experiencing issues, it's likely due to:

1. Bot not being restarted after configuration changes
2. Network connectivity issues
3. API rate limiting (free tier: 333 calls/day)
4. Users not asking in a way that triggers the auto-enable system

The tool is ready for use and should work seamlessly with the auto-enable system!
