### Basic Test

1. **Share Information:**

   ```
   My name is Jimmy
   ```

2. **Bot Response:**

   ```
   Nice to meet you, Jimmy! I'll remember that for our future conversations.
   ```

3. **Ask for Recall:**

   ```
   What's my name?
   ```

4. **Bot Response:**

   ```
   Your name is Jimmy! I remembered that from our previous conversation.
   ```

### Advanced Test

1. **Share Multiple Facts:**

   ```
   I love pizza, my favorite color is blue, and I'm a software developer
   ```

2. **Ask Complex Questions:**

   ```
   What do you know about me?
   ```

3. **Bot Response:**

   ```
   Based on what I remember: Your name is Jimmy, you love pizza, your favorite color is blue, and you're a software developer!
   ```

## üìù What Gets Remembered

### ‚úÖ **DO Remember:**

- Names and personal details
- Preferences and favorites
- Interests and hobbies
- Important dates
- Skills and expertise
- Relationships and pets

### ‚ùå **DON'T Remember:**

- Temporary requests
- Commands and instructions
- Non-personal information
- Sensitive data

### üîç **Username Association**

**Important**: All stored facts are automatically prefixed with the username who shared them in the format `[Username] fact_text`.

**Benefits:**
- **Clear Attribution**: You can see exactly who shared what information
- **No Confusion**: Multiple users can share similar information without conflicts
- **Personal Context**: Names and preferences are clearly linked to specific users
- **Better Recall**: The bot can distinguish between different users' information

**Examples:**
```
[Jimmy] my name is Jimmy
[Jimmy] I like pizza
[Sarah] my name is Sarah  
[Sarah] I love hiking
```

This prevents confusion when multiple users have similar names or preferences!
