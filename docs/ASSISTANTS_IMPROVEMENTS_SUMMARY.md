# Assistants.yaml Improvements Summary

## ðŸ”§ **Improvements Made**

I've significantly enhanced the `data/assistants.yaml` file to improve tool auto-enabling across all models. Here are the key improvements:

### âœ… **1. Comprehensive Tool Usage Guidelines**

Added detailed usage guidelines for each major tool:

#### **Cryptocurrency Price Tool Guidelines**

- **Purpose**: Real-time crypto prices, market data, and token information
- **When to Use**: Any mention of cryptocurrency prices, tokens, or market data
- **How to Use**: `get_token_price(symbol_or_id)` with crypto symbols or IDs
- **Examples**: BTC, ETH, SOL, BONK price checks with natural responses
- **Response Integration**: Blend price data naturally without mentioning the tool

#### **Currency Converter Tool Guidelines**

- **Purpose**: Real-time currency conversions between 170+ currencies
- **When to Use**: Currency conversion questions or exchange rate requests
- **How to Use**: `convert_currency(amount, from_currency, to_currency)`
- **Examples**: USD to EUR, JPY to USD conversions with casual responses

#### **Memory Tool Guidelines**

- **Purpose**: Remember and recall user information and preferences
- **When to Use**: Personal information, past conversations, user preferences
- **How to Use**: `remember(fact, category)` and `recall(query)`
- **Examples**: Storing sports preferences, recalling past conversations

#### **Python Code Execution Guidelines**

- **Purpose**: Run Python code for calculations and data analysis
- **When to Use**: Mathematical operations, calculations, data processing
- **How to Use**: Execute Python code for required computations
- **Safety**: Only run safe, non-harmful code
- **Examples**: Percentage calculations, compound interest, mathematical operations

### âœ… **2. Enhanced Auto-Tool Enabling System**

Improved the auto-tool enabling section with:

#### **Tool Detection Triggers**

- **Crypto Prices**: Any mention of cryptocurrency prices, tokens, or market data
- **Currency Conversion**: Questions about exchange rates or currency conversion
- **Web Search**: Current events, news, or information requests
- **Calculations**: Mathematical operations or data analysis
- **Memory**: Personal information or past conversations

#### **Proactive Usage Guidelines**

- Don't wait for explicit tool requests
- Automatically use appropriate tools when questions require external data
- Natural integration of tool results into responses

#### **Tool Priority System**

- **Price/Value Questions**: CryptoPrice for crypto, CurrencyConverter for fiat
- **Current Information**: ExaSearch for news, CryptoPrice for market data
- **Calculations**: CodeExecution for math, CurrencyConverter for conversions
- **Personal Context**: Memory for user preferences and past conversations

#### **Combined Tool Usage**

- Support for using multiple tools in sequence
- Example: Get crypto price then convert to different currency

### âœ… **3. Enhanced Style Examples**

Added new style examples showing proper tool usage:

- **Crypto Price Example**: "What's Bitcoin worth?" â†’ "BTC sitting at $110k rn, up 0.6% today. Crypto bros eating good ðŸ’°"
- **Currency Conversion Example**: "Convert 1000 USD to EUR" â†’ "1000 USD = 925 EUR. Euro looking weak rn ðŸ’€"
- **Calculation Example**: "Calculate 15% of 250" â†’ "15% of 250 = 37.5. Math checks out âœ…"

### âœ… **4. Improved Response Guidelines**

Enhanced guidelines for:

- **Natural Integration**: Blend tool results naturally without mentioning tools
- **Proactive Detection**: Automatically detect when tools are needed
- **Seamless Experience**: Users don't need to know about tool switching
- **Consistent Tone**: Maintain Jakey's personality across all tool responses

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Improvements**

These changes should result in:

### **Better Auto-Enabling**

- More reliable automatic tool activation
- Improved detection of when tools are needed
- Consistent behavior across all AI models

### **Enhanced User Experience**

- Seamless tool usage without manual activation
- Natural responses that don't mention tool usage
- Faster and more accurate responses

### **Improved Crypto Price Tool Usage**

- Automatic activation when users ask about crypto prices
- Better detection of cryptocurrency-related queries
- More natural integration of price data into responses

### **Consistent Tool Behavior**

- Standardized usage patterns across all tools
- Clear guidelines for when and how to use each tool
- Better tool priority and combination logic

## ðŸš€ **Key Benefits**

1. **Automatic Detection**: Tools now automatically activate based on user queries
2. **Natural Responses**: Tool results are integrated naturally without mentioning the tools
3. **Proactive Usage**: Jakey will use tools proactively when needed
4. **Better Crypto Support**: Enhanced cryptocurrency price tool usage
5. **Consistent Behavior**: Standardized tool usage across all models
6. **Improved Accuracy**: Better tool selection and usage patterns

## ðŸ“‹ **Testing Recommendations**

To verify the improvements work:

1. **Test Crypto Price Queries**:
   - "What's Bitcoin worth?"
   - "Check SOL price"
   - "How much is ETH worth?"

2. **Test Currency Conversion**:
   - "Convert 1000 USD to EUR"
   - "How much is 5000 yen in dollars?"

3. **Test Calculations**:
   - "Calculate 15% of 250"
   - "What's 20% of 1000?"

4. **Test Memory**:
   - "Remember I like the Chiefs"
   - "What did we talk about last time?"

The improvements should make the auto-enabling system work much better across all models, especially for the CryptoPrice tool!
