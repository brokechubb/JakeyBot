# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This document answers the most common questions about JakeyBot. If you don't find your answer here, check the other documentation files or reach out to the community.

## ü§ñ **Bot Behavior & Responses**

### Q: How can I make JakeyBot answer responses in its pure form?

**A**: JakeyBot has a system instruction set that refers to itself, its features, and other knowledge with human-like response vibes. Currently, there's no option to change this as system instructions are part of the context history and are cached.

**Alternative**: You can use the `/ask` command for more direct responses or specify your preferred tone in your prompts.

### Q: What is the default model used?

**A**:

- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for balanced chat experiences with thinking capability
- **GPT-4.1 mini** for OpenRouter-based chats
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash Nonthinking** for most commands like `/summarize` or message actions

You can change models using:

- `/ask` command with different providers
- `/model set:` command to stick with a specific model

---

### Q: When I switch models, why don't they remember what we discussed?

**A**: This is normal behavior! Your chat session gets divided per model provider:

- **OpenAI conversations** have their own memory
- **Claude conversations** have their own memory  
- **Gemini conversations** have their own memory

Each model maintains separate conversation contexts for optimal performance and privacy.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tools & Features**

### Q: How do I enable tools?

**A**: Use the `/feature` command to enable specific tools:

```
/feature Memory          # Enable Memory tool
/generate_image         # Generate images directly
/feature ExaSearch       # Enable Web Search
/feature GitHub          # Enable GitHub integration
```

**Note**: Only one tool can be active per chat thread, and switching tools will clear your chat history.

---

### Q: What API keys do I need?

**A**: Required API keys depend on which features you want:

**Essential**:

- `DISCORD_TOKEN` - Your Discord bot token
- `MONGO_DB_URL` - MongoDB connection string

**AI Models**:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - For Gemini models
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For GPT models
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For Claude models

**Tools**:

- `EXA_API_KEY` - For web search

## üìÅ **File Support & Attachments**

### Q: What type of files can I provide with my prompts?

**A**: File support varies by model:

- **Gemini**: Images, Audio, Video, PDF
- **Anthropic/OpenRouter**: Images, PDF

**Note**: Files are automatically deleted after processing for privacy.

---

### Q: How do I use IdeationTools for file generation?

**A**:

1. Enable the tool: `/feature IdeationTools`
2. Ask JakeyBot to create files (code, markdown, etc.)
3. Ensure the bot has permission to send attachments
4. Files will be generated and shared in the chat

---

## üè† **Self-Hosting & DMs**

### Q: I get errors when using JakeyBot in DMs

**A**: You need to install the app first:

1. Go to JakeyBot's profile card
2. Tap "Add app"
3. Click "Try it yourself"
4. Then you can use `/ask` and `/sweep` commands in DMs

Without this, you'll get "Integration error" when using commands directly.

---

### Q: Why can't I use the ask command in other servers?

**A**: The `/ask` command has restrictions due to Discord's user-installable app limitations:

- **Works in**: DMs and authorized guilds
- **Doesn't work in**: Servers where JakeyBot isn't fully authorized

This is because the command uses `ctx.send` which isn't allowed with user-installable apps.

## üß† **Memory & Context**

### Q: How does the Memory tool work?

**A**: The Memory tool automatically:

1. **Detects** when you share personal information
2. **Stores** facts with automatic categorization
3. **Recalls** relevant information when you ask questions
4. **Maintains** privacy with user isolation

**Setup**: Run `python scripts/setup_memory.py` to enable it as default.

---

### Q: What information gets remembered?

**A**: The Memory tool remembers:

**‚úÖ Personal Information**:

- Names and details
- Preferences and favorites
- Interests and hobbies

## üîí **Privacy & Data Handling**

### Q: How is my data handled?

**A**:

- **Chat history**: Stored in MongoDB database (self-hosted)
- **Files**: Automatically deleted after processing
- **Privacy**: User isolation and guild separation
- **Training**: Your data is NOT used to train models

**Self-hosting**: Use your own paid API keys for full control and privacy.

---

### Q: Is my data secure?

**A**: JakeyBot implements several security measures:

- **Environment variables** for all sensitive data
- **Database isolation** by user and guild
