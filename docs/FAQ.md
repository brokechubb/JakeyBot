# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This document answers the most common questions about JakeyBot. If you don't find your answer here, check the other documentation files or reach out to the community.

## ü§ñ **Bot Behavior & Responses**

### Q: How can I make JakeyBot answer responses in its pure form?

**A**: JakeyBot has a system instruction set that refers to itself, its features, and other knowledge with human-like response vibes. Currently, there's no option to change this as system instructions are part of the context history and are cached.

**Alternative**: You can use the `/ask` command for more direct responses or specify your preferred tone in your prompts.

---

### Q: What is the default model used?

**A**:

- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for balanced chat experiences with thinking capability
- **GPT-4.1 mini** for OpenRouter-based chats
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash Nonthinking** for most commands like `/summarize` or message actions
- **Pollinations.AI models** for uncensored responses

You can change models using:

- `/ask` command with different providers
- `/model set:` command to stick with a specific model

---

### Q: When I switch models, why don't they remember what we discussed?

**A**: This is normal behavior! Your chat session gets divided per model provider:

- **OpenAI conversations** have their own memory
- **Claude conversations** have their own memory  
- **Gemini conversations** have their own memory
- **Pollinations.AI conversations** have their own memory

Each model maintains separate conversation contexts for optimal performance and privacy.

## üîÑ **Auto-Return System**

### Q: What is the auto-return system?

**A**: The auto-return system automatically manages tool usage for you:

- **Automatic Tool Activation**: Tools are automatically enabled when needed
- **Smart Timeout Management**: Tools return to Memory after configurable timeouts
- **Intelligent Suggestions**: Get optimization tips with `/smart_suggestions`
- **Seamless Experience**: No manual tool management required

---

### Q: How do I extend the timeout for a tool?

**A**: Use the `/extend_timeout` command:

```
/extend_timeout 5m    # Add 5 minutes
/extend_timeout 2h    # Add 2 hours
/extend_timeout 30m   # Add 30 minutes
```

---

### Q: How do I check how much time is left on my current tool?

**A**: Use `/timeout_status` to see remaining time:

```
/timeout_status
```

This will show you the current tool and how much time is left before it auto-returns to Memory.

---

### Q: What are smart suggestions?

**A**: Smart suggestions provide personalized optimization tips:

```
/smart_suggestions
```

**Example suggestions:**

- "You've been using CodeExecution for 8 minutes. Consider extending with `/extend_timeout 5m`"
- "For image generation, try `/generate_image` directly - no tool switching needed!"
- "You're doing a lot of web searches. Consider using `/feature ExaSearch` for a longer session"

---

### Q: How do I return to Memory immediately?

**A**: Use `/return_to_default` to immediately return to the Memory tool:

```
/return_to_default
```

---

```

This creates an interactive betting pool where users can vote on the options.

---
